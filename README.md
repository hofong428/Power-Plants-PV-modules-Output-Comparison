Solar Power Plant efficiency assesment and prediction
### Solar Power Plant 1
Solar Panels are made up of different photovoltaic cells connected in series. To understand the working of the solar power generation. We first have to understand what are photovoltaic cells, what are they made up of and how do they generate Dc Power with the help of irradiation from the Sun. Photovoltaic cells are made up by combining two types of sillicone materials one over another. The upper part of the cell contains N-Type semiconductors containing excess electrons and the bottom part is made up of P-Type semiconductor containing holes. When they are connected a P-N Junction is formed at boundary of the two.  
When photons hit the electrons at the N-Type junction the electron absorbs its energy and try to move to the P-Type semiconductor creating a flow of charge generating a potential difference between the two sides thus resulting in Dc Power Generation.
Then the Dc Power is transfered to the Inverters which converts it into Ac Power and then steps up the current according to the requirement of the plant.  

**Typically the factors that determine the efficiency of the solar power plant are:**
- The Irradiation falling on the solar panels.
- Cleanliness of the solar panels.
- Inverter efficiency
- Ambient Temperature (For the plant to work efficiently, the ideal temperature ranges between 35 - 50 degress C.)
- Inverter or Panel Seniority

**Each solar power plant consists at least of two components:**  
- Modules-that convert sunlight into electricity.  
- One or more inverters-devices that convert direct current(DC) into alternating current(AC).  
** The factors that determine the performance of a solar power plant:  
- Temperature
- Dirtiness
- Inverters Efficiency
- Inverters or panels seniority

**Problem**  
- Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?
- Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
